### Contributing Code

We love pull requests! Here's how to contribute code:

#### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Cybernetic-Navigator.git
   cd Cybernetic-Navigator
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Create a feature branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Set up your environment:**
   - Create a `.env.local` file
   - Add your `API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key`

6. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

#### Development Guidelines

**Code Style:**
- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions
- Use **functional components** with React hooks
- Maintain the **cyberpunk aesthetic** in any UI changes
- Write **clear, descriptive variable names**
- Add **comments** for complex logic

**Component Guidelines:**
- Keep components **focused and single-purpose**
- Use **TypeScript interfaces** for props
- Implement **proper error handling**
- Ensure components are **responsive**
- Maintain **accessibility** standards

**Styling:**
- Use **CSS variables** for theming (see existing `--primary-color`, etc.)
- Maintain the **cyberpunk aesthetic** (neon colors, glow effects, dark backgrounds)
- Ensure **responsive design** works on various screen sizes
- Test theme changes with the AI theme generator

**State Management:**
- Use **React hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useRef`)
- Implement **localStorage** for data persistence when appropriate
- Keep state **as local as possible** to components
- Use **proper TypeScript types** for state

**API Integration:**
- All AI features should use the **geminiService.ts**
- Handle **API errors gracefully** with user-friendly messages
- Support both **environment variable** and **session API keys**
- Test with and without API keys configured

#### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   Ensure there are no TypeScript errors or build failures.

2. **Test all features:**
   - Test your new feature/fix thoroughly
   - Test with different API key configurations
   - Test theme generation with various inputs
   - Verify data persistence (bookmarks, history, settings)
   - Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

3. **Test browser compatibility:**
   - Chrome/Edge (primary)
   - Firefox
   - Safari (if possible)

4. **Check the console:**
   - No errors or warnings in the browser console
   - No TypeScript errors
